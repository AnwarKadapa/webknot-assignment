# Reports & Outputs (No-Code Submission)

Since this is just a design, Iâ€™ve written the reports as SQL-style queries to show how they could work. Later, when a real database or backend exists, these queries could be used to generate CSVs or JSON reports.

1) Event Popularity
Shows which events had the most confirmed registrations.

2) Attendance Percentage
Calculates the % of registered students who actually attended each event.

3) Average Feedback
Shows the average rating for each event and how many students submitted feedback.

4) Student Participation
Counts how many events each student attended.

5) Top Active Students
Lists students who attended the most events.

6) Filter by Event Type
Allows reports to be filtered by event type Workshop, Hackathon, Seminar, Fest, etc.
Later, when a real database or app is built, these queries can also be exported into reports or CSVs.
