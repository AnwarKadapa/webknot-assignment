# Reports & Outputs (No-Code Submission)

This file lists the **report definitions** and **SQL-style queries** that the backend could use.  
You may copy these into your design document or keep them here and reference them from the README.

- Event Popularity → see query 9.1 in DesignDocument.md
- Attendance % → see query 9.2
- Average Feedback → see query 9.3
- Student Participation → see query 9.4
- Top N Active Students → see query 9.5
- Filter by Event Type → see query 9.6

If you prefer, export these results as CSVs later when an API or DB exists.
